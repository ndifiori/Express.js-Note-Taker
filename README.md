# Express.js Note Taker
Bootcamp Challenge 11

## Your Task

My task was to create an application that allowed users to take notes and save them. This application used an Express.js backend and takes advantage of routing to handle our HTTP request. Furthermore, this application uses HTTP methods to save and retrieve data from a JSON file. 


## Preview

Here is a preview of the deployed application.
